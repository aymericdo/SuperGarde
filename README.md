# Super-Garde

This is a project is inspired by [pocketbase-sveltekit-auth](https://github.com/jianyuan/pocketbase-sveltekit-auth), thanks to him.

## Developing

To get started with this project, you will need to have PocketBase installed and running on your system. You can find more information about installing and setting up PocketBase at the [PocketBase website](https://pocketbase.io/).

```
./pocketbase serve
```

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
